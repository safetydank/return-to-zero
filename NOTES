- a swarm has an active property indicating if it is presently active on the current level
- a swarm has a render() method that draws itself
- a swarm has a move() method that handles AI of its members

Planning:

- LevelManager holds all game entities:

  -  dumb swarms, can be bound to different textures
  -  multi-swarm, particles can multiply, creating new entities within the swarm
  -  Chasers, "strings" of particles that home in quickly on the player
  -  powerups
     - increased shot size
     - dispersed shots
     - faster shot speed
     - reverse shots
  -  particle/explosion renderers, 1 per type of explosion

- Collision groups:

  0 Ship (player)
  1 Ship bullets
  2 Enemies
  3 Enemy bullets
  4 Static items

  Check:

  0 : 2 -> reduce player health
  0 : 3 -> reduce player health
  1 : 3 -> destroy enemies
  1 : 4 -> modify game (powerups etc.) - compare bounding circles only!


Tasks:
 - 2 new swarms, the string chaser
 - Powerups
 - Graphics
 - Music
 - Life system
